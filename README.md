# RIROptimisationCode
A code for optimising the injection configuration for the RIR reduced order modelling simulatons.

-- The files in the folder are standalone and only require inputs that are; the porosity map (as an .csv file, see example in repository),
the macro file (as .java, see example file in repository), and the sim file (as .sim, no example in repository).
-- The information required for optimisation works is mentioned and detailed in the scripts, options and settings are done in-code.
-- 'Optimisation Files' folder has some output files to give an example of sim setup and results extracted.
-- No simulation files are here (even for example) because of 25MB upload limit (my files are about 40MB meshed, it fails as an example if unmeshed).
